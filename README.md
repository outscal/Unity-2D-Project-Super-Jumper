This will be a comprehensive guide, so hold your horses and try to implement every concept that you have learned in the Getting Started with Unity. If you have not gone through this course, I highly recommend you to do that first before jumping onto this project here - [Getting Started with Unity](https://academy.outscal.com/getting-started-with-unity)

The first part of any game is of course moving the player object, you will learn how to do that in the next chapter.
