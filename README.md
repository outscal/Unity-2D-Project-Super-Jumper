This will be a comprehensive guide, so hold your horses and try to implement every concept that you have learned in the Getting Started with Unity. If you have not gone through this course, we highly recommend you to do that first before jumping onto this project here - [Getting Started with Unity](https://academy.outscal.com/getting-started-with-unity)

The first part of any game is of course moving the player object, you will learn how to do that in the next chapter.
