# Game Over

And Finally the game needs to over right? At some point there needs to be an end to a chapter. ðŸ˜’

Whenever our player is out of lives or we run out of time to complete a level we see a certain screen that tells us what exactly??? ðŸ¤” Thatâ€™s right it tells us that our game is over.

Thereâ€™s a certain condition after which we lose our game or we can say that our game gets over. The condition can be anything we might run out of time or we might have come in contact of enemy or we might run out of lives.

Let me show you how to make the game over when our player gets detected by our enemy.

In the above code the game gets over when the player is detected by the enemyâ€™s raycast within a range. Once the player is detected we are freezing the time in the time which is equivalent to pausing the game. After that I am setting the visibility of my game over panel as true which is initially false before the game starts. When the game gets over this is basically what you see.
