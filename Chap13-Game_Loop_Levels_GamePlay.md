# Game Loop/Levels/GamePlay

- Super Jumper is a level-based game. Every level will have its own complexity and toughness. As of now, we would suggest a 3 level architecture that we can add to this project but of course, you are free to design more levels as you wish to. Every level that has been completed will unlock a new feature for the player that will help the player in completing the further levels. Every level completed will show a ‚ÄúLevel completed‚Äù text/panel and will also be displaying which ability has been unlocked for the player.

Level 1: This will be a basic level that will allow the user to explore the level and play around with and as it is the very first level the difficulty level will be minimal üòú. Some enemies will be added in the very first level to make it a little challenging for the player, please feel free to design the level as you like with enemies and static platforms

Level 2: Once level 1 has been completed a new feature named double/triple jump can be unlocked for the player. This feature will help the player in covering distances that is far away and which cannot be covered by a single jump. Of course, there will be collectibles that the player would have to pick up first to activate the Special Jump ability. Also, you can add moving platforms to this level to make it a little tougher for the player. üòé

Level 3: Once level 2 has been completed a new feature called Dash/Speed booster will be unlocked for the player. This feature will help the player in covering very long distances which cannot be reached by double/triple jumps. Of course, there can be another type of collectible that the player would have to pick up first to activate the Special Dash ability üòØ. All other features i.e. patrolling enemies & falling platforms can also be included in this particular level.

You can add further levels based on your vision of your game. Remember this is your game and it has to be fun for you to play when you play it yourself. You can add interesting stuff to the game, taking references from other 2D platformer type games as well.
